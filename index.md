I studied mathematics with a sprinkling of computer science, data science, and liberal arts at [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/). I currently teach coding and robotics to kids aged 7-16. At any given time, I'm usually working on learning at least one thing, whether a language (programming or human), subject area, or physical skill. I occasionally make things, and I put some of the ones I'm proud of on this website.

I took the [10% Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge) at [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) in 2022, which means I have committed to giving at least 10% of my lifetime income to the organisations that can most effectively help others. I would be happy to chat more about effective giving!
